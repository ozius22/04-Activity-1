      <p class="text-base text-gray-800 font-serif tracking-wide pt-16 text-justify">As I navigated the website, I could not help but notice the outdated, confusing, and inefficient user interface design. It has no clear navigation panel where I can traverse the website without getting lost. Moreover, the placement and design of the elements and modules on the website are inconsistent, which made it difficult to distinguish and remember basic functions. The website's content was cluttered, and its purpose was not immediately clear, leaving me unsure about what it was meant to accomplish. Overall, I had a bad user experiennce. I will surely not come back again.</p>

      <header class="bg-green-200 p-8 hover:text-gray-200 hover:bg-gray-800 transition-colors cursor-pointer">
        <h1 class="font-sans font-extrabold text-center">Content</h1>
      </header>
      <p class="text-base text-gray-800 font-serif tracking-wide pt-16 text-justify">Upon examining the website's content, I found that the landing page was disorganized and cluttered. The various items on display appeared to be for sale, but they were not properly labeled or arranged. Additionally, some of the information presented was unclear and seemed random. I also noticed sponsored content pieces that directed users to a completely different website, which did not align with the website's purposes. <br><br>

        The images used on the website were stacked on top of each other, without any clear order or uniform sizes. While the mosaic-like structure had an artistic touch, it did not make logical sense and added to the overall chaos of the page. However, I did find that the information about specific products was helpful and relevant. <br><br>
        
        Overall, I believe that the website's design and organization could be improved to better serve its users and accomplish its objectives.</p>

        <h1 class="font-sans font-extrabold text-center">Grid Layout</h1>
      </header>
      <p class="text-base text-gray-800 font-serif tracking-wide pt-16 text-justify">There were no clear columns or rows, and the grid layout was non-existent. Some elements were outside of containers while others were contained within them. Proper alignment was not observed, making it difficult to identify which elements belonged together. CSS grid layout would have been a solution for creating a flexible layout that works well on different screen sizes, but it was not applied on this website. Overall, the website was poorly designed and completely sabotaged responsiveness.</p>
